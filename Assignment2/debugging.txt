I experienced quite a few errors while developing this page up until Assignment 2. Depending on what I was working on I used different methods to debug. Here I list the main aspects of the coding and how I debugged any errors associated with that aspect.


Javascript - I did not experience many JS errors but the ones I did I was able to debug by using console.log statements 

D3 - I decided to use D3 a bit in this assignment and I debugged any errors by referencing online material and also inspecting the elements I was adding and its attributes

HTML - I do not recall having any HTML errors in this assignment as I tried to do most things through JS.
